# Energy-Outlook
Repository for a project about how Carbon dioxide emissions and Energy production have evolved in the past years. 

# Introduction
Energy production has surged in recent years due to a notable increase in demand, primarily due to population growth, coupled with rising standards of living and a rapid industrial development. Energy production is closely linked to carbon dioxide emissions, because the dominant sources of energy globally are fossil fuels, like coal, oil and natural gas.

# Data 
The data was downloaded from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), and contains information from 1980 to 2021, including energy production by source and country, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) by country.

# Key questions and objecctives
The objective of the project is to answer these questions, among others:
- Is there a relationship between energy production and Gross Domestic Product?
- How have energy production and CO2 emissions evolved in the past years? 
- Which countries emit the most CO2? How have they changed their emissions and their energy sources mix? 
- What is their renewables energy mix?
- How have the CO2 emissions changed in the last years?
